    <p>Guess what?  <em><strong>You're done!!!</strong></em> Congratulations, you just "finished" your first rails app!</p>

    <p>(They're never <em>really</em> ever finished... have fun tweaking it!)</p>

    <h2>Extra Credit</h2>

    <p>If you got all the way through Suggestotron with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does</li>
      <li>Sort topics by their number of votes</li>
      <li>Add an 'about' page, linked from the bottom of the Suggestotron topics list. Link back to the Topics list from the About page so users don't get stranded.</li>
      <li>
        If your class has a <strong>lot</strong> of time left over:
        <ul>
          <li>Users should be allowed to vote only once: give votes a user_id and allow a user to have voted on each topic only once. But wait, what is a 'user' in our system? Get a volunteer to introduce everyone to <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, a simple way to add authentication to a Rails application.</li>
          <li>Users should be able to give a post a 'negative' vote instead of a positive one. How might you represent that in this system?</li>
        </ul>
