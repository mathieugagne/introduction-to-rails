    <h3>Goal</h3>

    <p>
      To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World"
      example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
      friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
      allow users to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>view the topics sorted by number of votes</li>
      <li>vote on topics</li>
      <li>create, edit, and destroy topics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:
    </p>

    <p>
      <%= image_tag 'finished_app.png', alt: '' %>
    </p>

    <h3>Meta-Goal</h3>

    <p>
      When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
      application online you should understand:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application</li>
      <li>The basic tools a RoR developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)</li>
      <li>Migrations</li>
      <li>CRUD with Scaffolding</li>
      <li>Rails Generators</li>
      <li>MVC Structure</li>
      <li>Rails Routing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>
      We're going to be working with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ruby 2.1.1</li>
      <li>Rails 4.1.x</li>
      <li>Bundler</li>
      <li>sqlite</li>
      <li>Terminal</li>
      <li>Sublime Text</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal:
    </p>

    <div class="console">
      <pre>$ irb
&gt;&gt; 1 + 2
=&gt; 3
&gt;&gt; require "active_support"
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; exit
$
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Working Effectively and Efficiently</h3>

    <p>
      I highly recommend you do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bring up your terminal and open 2 tabs:

        <ul>
          <li>One is for regular terminal stuffs</li>
          <li>One will be for irb (aka rails console). We'll explain later</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.

        <ul>
          <li>Bring up one window with two tabs</li>
          <li>One for this content</li>
          <li>One for interacting with your app.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open your text editor and <em>do not ever close it</em>. We're not quitters.</li>
      <li>Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
      amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
      you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
      browser gets confusing and wastes time.
    </p>

    <h3>Format</h3>

    <p>
      Each lesson will look like this:
    </p>

    <div class='well'>
      <h1 class="doc_title" style="margin-top: 0em;">Step Title</h1>
      <div class="goals">
        <h1>Goal:</h1>
        <p>
          Description of the current step.

        </p>
        <p>
          Red because big goals are scary.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="steps">
        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <pre class="term">steps to take.</pre>
        <div class="console">
          <pre>
def code_to_write
  1 + 1
end</pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
          <h1>Explanation</h1>
          <p>
            Details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Green because we can tie everything together now.
          </p>

      </div>
